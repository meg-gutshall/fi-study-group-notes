# Codepanionship Study Group Ad Post Template: Twitter

> _Iâ€™ll post this out on Twitter every once in a while. You can too if you want and like I said before, make it your own! I normally ask Flatironâ€™s account to Retweet it as well. Sometimes they do, sometimes they donâ€™t._

Tomorrow at 12:00 NOON EDT!ðŸŒž We All Need a Little Codepanionship ðŸŒž Lunch break with your \#codepanions! Share what youâ€™re working on, ask for advice, exchange tips & tricks, find accountability â€” just bring \#encouragement & \#positivity!
