## The Contributions Graph

* Frequency of commits make up the hues of green
  * 1 commit = light green square
  * 10–20 = medium green square
  * 20+ = dark green square
* Commits on private repos count!

## Contribution Activity

* Looking for:
  * Contributions to open-source projects
  * Group collaboration
  * Your own repos

## Profile Information

* Professional photo
* Bio
* Contact info:
  * Your portfolio
  * LinkedIn profile
  * Email address

## Pinned Repos

* At least one project you've committed to recently
* A diversity of technology
* Projects you've created/contributed to, not labs or tutorials

## What a Pinned Repo Must Have

* A solid README
  * Photos, GIFs, and video that demo what the app does
  * User story
* Description and deployment link
* Commit messages and properly syntaxed and professional
* Follows file structure convention specific to the technology
* Clean code

## What Makes a Good README

* Include demo videos and deployment links
* Include GIFs \(at the very least screen shots\)
* Extras: wireframes, ...

## Commit Messages

* Must be in the imperative case
  * We are giving out computer a command
* Must be specific to the function...

## File Structure

* Did you research file organization for the technology?
* Would you be able to explain why you set it up the way you

## Clean Code: Principles to Judge Code By

* Code should be creative
* Remove `console.log` commands
* Code should be properly structured
* Code should follow the single responsibility...

### Creative Code

Code that is unique to what your application is doing. A great example of this is if you have a backend, write something beyond the methods...

### Remove `console.log` Commands & Comments

100% of programmers agree you should not have `console.log` commands in your submitted code. \(Same for catch and try statements.\)

50% of programmers feel the same way about comments. Some think this is a sign that you're not naming your variables correctly.

### Properly Structured Code

Proper indentation, correct naming scheme, use a linter

### Your Code Tells a Story

Variable names should be specific to the data they are storing.

Function names should be specific to the function they are performing, but abstract enough to be reusable in handling different kinds of data.

### The Single Responsibility Principle

**A function is responsible for one thing.**

Rule of thumb: A function should be 2–5 lines of code.

#### Questions to Ask yourself & Grads

* Do any of the functions exceed 3–5 lines

### Your Code Should Be DRY

**Do Not Repeat Yourself.**

Rule of thumb: Introduce a helper function when one has performed the same task more than once.

P.S.:

### Conscientious with Our Data

* Do not perform unnecessary fetch calls
* Only pass the data to the functions that actually need it
  * Same goes for state and props

#### What we're looking for:

* Is your code following the single source of truth principle?
* Any

### A Note on Cleverness...

## Call to Action

* Ask someone to grill your code for you:
  * Fellow grad
  * Former instructor
  * Your career coach
  * A networking contact
