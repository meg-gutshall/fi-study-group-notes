# Speeding Up Your Rails App

> **Jenn Hansen on 02/20/19 & 11/17/19**

Speeding up an app always starts with the database.

## **Pre-Loading Associations**

* First and major way to speed up your app
* Associations actually have to render

### **Examples from the slides**

* On the `Cities#index` view, each listing of a city will also display the country, meaning that however many cities we have is how many times we query the database. This is way too much!
* On the homepage, all active users are listed and it displays the and it displays the cities the users have visited. Again, this is a lot of database queries.
  * The solution? Use `.includes`. It joins the cities table with the country table and the user table with the cities table so there isn't that additional query each time a city or a user is loadedâ€”it's already pre-loaded!
* You can give `.includes` multiple arguments and create a nested `.includes` too

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Cities\#index" %}
{% code title="cities\_controller.rb" %}
```ruby
def index
  @cities = City.all.includes(:country)
end

# :country is singular because a city belongs_to a country
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Homepage" %}
{% code title="users\_controller.rb" %}
```ruby
def index
  @users = User.active_users.includes(:cities)
end

# :cities is plural because a user has_many cities
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Removing Unnecessary Queries

| **Do...** | **Don't...** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Try to stick to one SQL query per table |  |
| Execute queries in the controller | Execute queries while loading partials |
| Preload associations | Put query methods, like `where`, in instance methods of a model |
| Create new associations that you can preload if you need to call a scope on an association when rendering collections | Call scopes on associations when you're rendering collections |
| Use `.present?` or `.blank?` | Use `.exists?` or `.empty?` |

## **`count` vs. `size`**

* `.count` will always query the database
  * Only use this if you need the count at that exact moment
* `.size` queries the database only if the query hasn't already been cached in memory
  * If you call `.size` before the association is loaded, you still end up with two queries. You can get around this by calling `.load.size` which will only execute one query.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Count" %}
```ruby
def count(column_name = nil)
  if block_given?
    #...
    return super()
  end
  
  calculate(:count, column_name)
end


<% @comments.each do |comment| %>
  <%= comment.text %>
<% end %>
<%= @comments.count %>

# This will execute two queries
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Size" %}
```ruby
def size
  loaded? ? @records.length : count(:all)
end


<% @comments.each do |comment| %>
  <%= comment.text %>
<% end %>
<%= @comments.size %>

# This will execute one query

<%= @post.comments.size %>
<% @post.comments.each do |comment| %>
  <%= comment.text %>
<% end %>

# This will execute two queries

<%= @post.comments.load.size %>
<% @post.comments.each do |comment| %>
  <%= comment.text %>
<% end %>

# This will execute one query
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Indexing Your Database**

Any column in your database that you will regularly use for queries should be indexed as long as that attribute or object isn't frequently deleted or created.

`rails generate migration AddIndexToContacts phone_number:string:index`

```ruby
class AddIndexToContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :contacts, :phone_number
  end
end
```

## Bullet Gem

{% embed url="https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet" %}

Basically a linter for N+1 queries

* Add to `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`
* Follow configuration instructions in the repo's `README.md`
  * Pick which types of notifications you want to receive from this gem
