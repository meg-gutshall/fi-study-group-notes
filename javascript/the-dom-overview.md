# The DOM Overview

> **Sophie Cruetz on 09/12/19**

* The DOM \(Document Object Model\) is a tree representation of the code structure
  * Parent nodes → above a child node
  * Child nodes → below a parent node
  * Sibling nodes → on the same level
* `<body>` is the main element of an HTML doc
  * Under this is a `<div>`
    * Then nested HTML elements under this
* Traversal is when you have to go through parent and sibling nodes to access a certain HTML element
* The DOM running in the browser is different than the source code
