## **Function Declaration vs. Function Expression**

* A function expression is when you set a variable equal to an anonymous function
* A function declaration is when you write function followed by the function name with possible parameters and then the code
* Function declarations can be called before they're defined, function expressions cannot because they are not hoisted

## **First Class Functions vs. Higher Order Functions**

* A higher order function takes in another function as one of its arguments
* A first class function is built specifically to pass into a higher order function
  * When we pass in a first class function, we aren't invoking it, we're just referencing it
  * Essentially the equivalent of passing in a block in Ruby
