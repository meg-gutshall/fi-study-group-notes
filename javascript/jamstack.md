# JAMstack

> **Mat Clutter on 04/24/19**

* A **stack** is a list of all the tech services used to run an application
  * Examples: LAMP, MEAN, MERN, RoR/MySQL, RoR/Postgres
* A JAMstack is a modern web developer architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and pre-built Markup \([https://jamstack.org/](https://jamstack.org/)\)
  * JavaScript, APIs, and Markup → doesn’t focus on specific technologies

## **Pros**

* Faster \(usually\), due to static site generators
* Flexibility through complete separation of front-end code from data/back-end \(refactoring, updating, changing section\)
* Better developer experience through keeping development separated
* Scaling/hosting

## **Cons**

* Interactivity with lots of data \(?\)
* Multiple servers/services involved
* Data build steps
