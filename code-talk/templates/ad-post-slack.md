## Example \#1: A Code Talk Guest Speaker

Hello everyone!! Come out to Code Talk: React Hooks on Thursday, October 17th at 8:30 pm EDT \(Study Group URL: [https://learn.co/study-groups/code-talk-react-hooks](https://learn.co/study-groups/code-talk-react-hooks), Zoom URL: [https://zoom.us/j/334437204](https://zoom.us/j/334437204)\). Our guest speaker is Ryan Heupler, a software engineer at Guru in Philly. Below is a synopsis of his talk:

The introduction of Hooks in React has become a very "buzz word" topic in the community, which, ultimately, has lead to some confusion. Some common questions I hear when talking to others are: What are they? How do you use them? Do they replace life-cycle methods and/or class components completely? We will go over all of these together. I'll start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle methods, custom methods and API interaction. I will then convert the components over to functional ones while integrating several different hooks, without losing any functionality. Finally, we will look into some common "gotchas" that may be confusing for people starting out with hooks. You will come away from this talk with a good foundation for various primitive hooks in React, and you'll understand how they're used and how you can start to write your own custom hooks.
