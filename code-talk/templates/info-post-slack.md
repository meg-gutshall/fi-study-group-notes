# Code Talk Study Group Info Post Template: Slack

> Change it up as needed—make it your own. This is just a guide!

Hello my codepanions! Can’t wait to start the week off right with our awesome group! Please read over the info below so the Code Talk session can run as smoothly as possible.

When you enter the call, please type in the chat what topic you’re studying in the curriculum. Not only is this session an exercise in speaking about code, but you could end up finding a great codepanion to pair up with in labs!

This will be today’s code challenge: \[LINK TO CHALLENGE\]

Once we separate into breakout rooms, I suggest that one person opens up a new [repl.it](https://repl.it/) session, clicks on the ‘Multiplayer’ icon on the left-hand sidebar, and clicks the ‘Start Session’ button to share the link with their other breakout codepanions to join in and code.

If anyone wants to share their code, note it in the chat when you pop in the session, reply here on Slack, DM me, or pipe up when I ask in the beginning and everyone stares at me silently and awkwardly! :D
