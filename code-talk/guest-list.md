We’ll open the floor for students to present their code \(labs, projects, side projects, etc.\) and practice speaking in technological terms. Afterward we’ll have a special guest, Ryan Stellar, answer all your questions related to startups—working for them, organizing them, funding them, anything you can think of! This is a great opportunity for any student who is interested in founding their own startup after graduation to get advice from someone who’s been there.

### Kayla Reopelle

**Date:** 04/01/2019

**Topic:** Rails Dual Boot

**Contact Info:** [Email](mailto:kreopelle@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylareopelle/), [GitHub](https://github.com/kreopelle)

**Summary:** “Dual Booting Your Rails Application: Ending the long-lived feature branch to build upgrade”

One of the web development’s never-ending struggles is keeping frameworks and dependencies up to date. As an application grows, upgrades become more daunting, but necessary nonetheless. During this Code Talk, I’ll share my findings from an ongoing experiment to upgrade large codebases using the dual boot method. Inspired by Rails giants Github and Shopify, dual booting puts two versions of Rails in the same repository to move upgrades out of an isolated feature branch and into the main development environment.

We’ll discuss:

* The myth of the rewrite, conquering technical debt, and prioritizing upgrades
* Advantages of a dual boot over the long-lived feature branch
* Implementing a dual boot
* Getting familiar with other versions of Ruby on Rails
* Lessons learned while navigating large, existing codebases
* Steps toward building maintainable applications

### Martin Snyder

### Bekah Hawrot Weigel

**Date:** 07/23/2019

**Topic:** Community and Gatekeepers

**Contact Info:** [Website](https://bekahhw.github.io/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bekah-hawrot-weigel/), [GitHub](https://github.com/BekahHW), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bekahhw), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bekahhw/)

**Summary:** One of our own, Bekah Hawrot Weigel \(@BekahHW\), has the opportunity to speak at this year's Mid-Atlantic Developer Conference! She has graciously agreed to give us a preview of her presentation "The Coder's Journey: Community and Gatekeepers" by doing a practice run in a Code Talk! Join us on Tuesday, July 23rd \(tomorrow\) at 8:00 pm EDT \(Study Group URL: [https://learn.co/study-groups/code-talk-mid-atlantic-developers-conference-prev](https://learn.co/study-groups/code-talk-mid-atlantic-developers-conference-prev), Zoom URL: [https://zoom.us/j/334437204](https://zoom.us/j/334437204)\).

Frodo couldn’t have made it to Mount Doom without his allies and companions. But at each step of the way there were gatekeepers trying to keep him from achieving his goals. Gatekeeping in tech is no new thing. By creating and getting involved in positive communities, we create stronger teams.

With the rise of second career devs thanks to internet resources and coding bootcamps, coding is for everyone. But it’s only for everyone if we stop gatekeeping and allow the community to prime us for success. Coming from a background in English, and learning to code when I had full-blown PTSD from a labor and delivery gone wrong, I found that not only did coding help me to overcome my PTSD, but it also gave me more resources than ever to solve my own problems. As I progressed in my bootcamp, I became involved in a number of coding communities, including Moms Can: Code, and found that both support for the personal journey along with the technical journey of coding, helped to ensure my growth as a developer. Gatekeeping isn’t just rejecting newbies, but it’s also not providing support for those with imposter syndrome, those coming back into the workplace after a gap in the resume for things like raising children, it’s rejecting people because you don’t feel like they fit into your “culture.” This talk will focus on community building and the strength it provides to teams and companies. It will give examples of how to build community, recognize gatekeeping, and create a positive atmosphere prime for positivity and growth.
